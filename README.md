# Discord-Plays-UNDERTALE

A bot that allows users to control the host computer and press inputs to control UNDERTALE.
In theory, this bot can be set up to play ANY game, but hey, undertale funni

## HOW TO SET UP:

To run this, you'll need a few basic things.

- A discord server
- A working copy of UNDERTALE
- Friends

Next, set up a bot in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
If you don't know how, there are many tutorials online. Its a really REALLY simple process and should only take you like 2 minutes

After that, get your bots token, and paste it into Discord-Plays-Undertale/config/token.txt.

Then, just add the bot to your server, run the exe, and open UNDERTALE!
Using commands, users in the server should be able to control the game.

**BUT BE CAREFUL, INPUTS GO THROUGH ON THE HOST COMPUTER, NOT JUST THE GAME!!! ITS RECCOMENDED TO DO THIS WITH TRUSTED SERVER MEMBERS.**
